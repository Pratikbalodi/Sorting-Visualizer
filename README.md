The project includes options to resize the array and visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort.
This tool is designed to help users understand how these algorithms work by displaying the step-by-step sorting process in a dynamic and intuitive manner
